# Stance Detection, Keyword Extraction, and Topic Modeling on YouTube Comments

This project focuses on analyzing YouTube comments to detect stances (Pro-Palestine, Pro-Israel, or Neutral) using a fine-tuned BERT model. Additionally, keyword extraction is performed using KBERT, and topic modeling is implemented using BeTopic.

## Features

- **Stance Detection**: Fine-tuned BERT model to classify YouTube comments into three categories:
  - Pro-Palestine
  - Pro-Israel
  - Neutral

- **Keyword Extraction**: Utilized KBERT to extract meaningful keywords from the comments.

- **Topic Modeling**: Applied BeTopic to identify and analyze prevalent topics within the dataset.

## Technologies Used

### Machine Learning Frameworks
- **BERT**: For stance detection and fine-tuning
- **KBERT**: For keyword extraction
- **BeTopic**: For topic modeling

### Programming and Libraries
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For BERT implementation
- **Other Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
